Conway's Game Of Life

============

==========

Fun little project to learn a bit about go. The easiest way to execute is just to cd to the src directory and type "go run .\gameOfLife.go"

There are a few option flags that you specify as well, you can see these by running "go run .\gameOfLife.go -help"

For example:
  go run gameOfLife.go -columns=50 -rows=20 -sleepMs=250 -iterations=0
